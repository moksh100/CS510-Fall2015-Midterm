# CS510-Fall2015-Midterm

Project shows the difference between Euler method and different orders of the Runge-Kutta method.

- attractor.py implementation of the calculation and visual representation Runge-Kutta and Euler methods
- ExploreAttractor.ipynb
 loads your module and uses it to answer the following explorative questions:
    How does the plotted solution depend on your choice of time step size, and your choice of increment?  Do you see an improvement in precision from using the higher-order integration methods?
    How does the solution depend upon the initial conditions [x0, y0, z0]?  How small a change can you make while still reproducing roughly the same dynamical curves?
- test_attractor.py module tests
